<p> Welcome to my citizenship website!
this is going to be a talk about what
it means to be a good citizen and be active
in your community. being a good citizen can
take many forms, one of which is community service.
when serving as a high chool student, community service
should play a big role in your life.
For example, at LS you are not qualified for a parking spot
until you have completed at least 12 hours of community service.
This requirment ensures that kids at LS are active in the community.
Also, many colleges want to see at least 20 hours of service
completed by the end of junior year. Other than that... i truly do
believe that citizenship is a self defined term. meaning that
it is up to you to determine what good citizenship is and anyone
else who trys to define it does not know what they are talking about.
