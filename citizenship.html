<p>   Welcome to my citizenship website!
this is going to be a talk about what
it means to be a good citizen and be active
in your community. being a good citizen can
take many forms, one of which is community service.
when serving as a high chool student, community service
should play a big role in your life.
For example, at LS you are not qualified for a parking spot
until you have completed at least 12 hours of community service.
This requirment ensures that kids at LS are active in the community.
Also, many colleges want to see at least 20 hours of service
completed by the end of junior year. Other than that... i truly do
believe that citizenship is a self defined term. meaning that
it is up to you to determine what good citizenship is and anyone
else who trys to define it does not know what they are talking about.</p>

<p> Kyrie Irving is a fantastic basketball player who has
  been praised in the past for his countless efforts
  in the community. He won a championship for Lebron when
  he made one of the clutchest shots in NBA playoff history.</p>

  <p> Another fantastic role model in the community is a baseball player
    by the name of Mike Trout. Mike Trout has won countless prestigous awards
    such as MVP and gold glove awards.</p>

    <p> Part of citizenship is sportsmanship. Simple, Right? Well not for these kids.
      They show horrible sportsmanship and give examples of how not to behave
      during any point in time.</p>
